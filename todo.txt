Current:
Bare-bones web GUI
try RTS Monad instead of transformer
Impove end game logic

Project organization:
Set the proper exports (comment out for debugging)

Overall:
alpha-beta pruning
additional profiling - improve performance
try using foundation (instead of prelude)
Reader monad for move eval (for depth, difficulty level, etc.)
Turn debugging display on/off
String to Text conversion -- ugh =(

TicTac:
Prefer win on next move (after reader monad)

Checkers:
Add score for "pinned" pieces
Add some specific blunder evaluation?
