Current:
Bare-bones web GUI
Test: is check blunders resulting in changed list of choices?
in text output, "Computers move s:Total X" -- X should be neg for black

Overall:
look for space leaks
make look-ahead increase with less pieces
alpha-beta pruning
additional profiling - improve performance
try using foundation (instead of prelude)
show number of positions searched and/or try to get from profiling
Reader monad for move eval (for depth, difficulty level, etc.)
Turn debugging display on/off

TicTac:
Prefer win on next move (after reader monad)

Checkers:
Add score for "pinned" pieces
End game improvment with opponent having one king only
Add some specific blunder evaluation?

Project organization:
move tictac to examples
packaging/organization (as per lens)
Set the proper exports (comment out for debugging)
